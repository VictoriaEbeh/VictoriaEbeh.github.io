    "text": "My photo\n\n\nHi! My name is Victoria Ebeh, and I am a master’s student in the Geospatial Information Sciences program. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Surveying & Geo-informatics (Second Class Upper) from one of the best private universities in Nigeria, Bells University of Technology, Ota, with a CGPA of 4.47 on a 5.0 scale. I am currently working as a DOC Technician at Oncor Electric Delivery, the largest transmission and distribution electric utility in the state of Texas. Before that, I worked as a GIS Analyst at the Lagos office of Arup, a global engineering consulting firm.\nI grew up in Grand Prairie, TX but have spent half my life in Nigeria. My parents wanted my brother and me, as the oldest of their kids, to learn about where we came from and our traditions. I have lived a very unique and special life, learning a vast number of lessons along the way. In my life, I have lived in various regions of two vastly different countries, exposing me to new cultures and contrasting experiences, and have thus learnt to adapt and accommodate in a way that is acceptable to new cultures.\nGIS has always been a subject that has fascinated me, as it combines my passion for geography, land surveying and technology to create a unique tool for problem solving and decision-making. The power to visualize and analyze spatial data, in combination with the ability to use this information to drive better outcomes, is what drew me to the field. I am particularly interested in the role of GIS technology and innovation in promoting sustainability and resilience in cities.\n\nMy Hobbies/likes\nI have a diverse range of hobbies and likes that reflect my varied interests. I find solace in the captivating worlds created by novels, where each page holds the promise of a new adventure or insight. Dancing allows me to express myself through movement, while word games challenge and stimulate my mind. Video games provide a dynamic and immersive form of entertainment, and watching movies allows me to explore different narratives and genres. Collectively, these activities contribute to a rich tapestry of leisure, blending creativity, mental engagement, and sheer enjoyment."

    "text": "Q1:  What are the differences between relation schema, relation and instance? Give an example using the university database to illustrate.)\n\nRelation Schema: A relation schema defines the structure of a table in a relational database. It specifies the names and types of attributes (columns) that will be present in the table. A relation schema consists of attributes and domains. For example, The “Department” relation schema may include attributes like department name, building, and budget. It can be written as department (dept name, building, budget).\nRelation: A relation, often referred to as a table, is the actual implementation of a relation schema. It is a set of rows, where each row represents a record or tuple, and each column represents an attribute. A relation corresponds to a programming-language variable. For example, the “Department” relation includes actual data, such as (Biology, Watson, 90000), (Comp.Sci, Taylor, 100000), where each tuple represents a department.\nInstance: An instance of a relation refers to the specific set of data contained in the relation at a given point in time. It represents the actual rows and values present in the table. A relation instance is comparable to the value of a variable. Its contents may change over time due to updates. The current data in the “Teaches” relation, including all existing course records, forms an instance of that relation. Consider figure 1 showing a sample of an instance of the “Teaches” relation which shows 15 tuples corresponding to 15 instructors and their class sections.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An instance of the “Teaches” relation\n\n\nQ2: Draw a schema diagram for the following bank database:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Schema for bank database\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Schema diagram for bank database\n\n\nQ3: Consider the above bank database. Assume that branch names (branch_name)and customer names (customer_name)uniquely identify branches and customers, but loans and accounts can be associated with more than one customer.\ni. What are the appropriate primary keys? (Underline each in diagram)\nPlease reference the figures 2 & 3 above for the primary keys underlined.\nii. Given your choice of primary keys, identify appropriate foreign keys\n\nLoan Relation Schema:\n\n\nbranch_name in Loan is a foreign key referencing branch_name in Branch.\n\n\nBorrower Relation Schema:\n\n\nID in Borrower is a foreign key referencing ID in Customer.\nloan_number in Borrower is a foreign key referencing loan_number in Loan.\n\n\nAccount Relation Schema:\n\n\nbranch_name in Account is a foreign key referencing branch_name in Branch.\n\n\nDepositor Relation Schema:\n\n\nID in Depositor is a foreign key referencing ID in Customer.\naccount_number in Depositor is a foreign key referencing account_number in Account.\n\n\nDownloads available here\n\n\n\nPDF Version available here\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerPoint Presentation (PDF) available here"

For example, the number of people interested in particular events or SDGs, notifications on events or error messages on data validation or submission, etc.\nNavigation menu/home menu: There will be a navigation menu for easy access to different sections (UXPin, 2023).\nData entry/Search and Filters: User-friendly forms for easy data entry with clear labels and instructions for the users/organizers. There will be a search tool or function for quick data retrieval. There will also be a filter function so users can refine their searches based on specific needs. Data will be displayed in interactive tables and will allow users to customize their view using checkboxes, dropdowns, etc. (UXPin, 2023).\nMap Representations/capabilities: It will use maps to show locational data. For example, show nearest events to users, etc.\nFeedback Mechanism: It will include feedback mechanisms for users to report issues about the app/events or suggest improvements.\nUser Permissions: There will be a control system to manage user authentication/authorization and ensure users only have access to the resources relevant to their roles (Frontegg, 2022)"

This is because a relational database is well-established, strong support, suitable for complex relationships. Relational databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns, and establishes relationships between tables (Silberschatz, A. et al, 2011).\nThe database will be created using a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), known as PostgreSQL.  This is an open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language to safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads (PostgreSQL, 2024)."

    "text": "Q1: Explain the difference between a weak and a strong entity set. Use an example other than the one in Chapter 6 to illustrate. (Consult Ch. 6, 6.5.3)\nA weak entity set has its existence dependent on another entity set referred to as its identifying entity set. Instead of having its own primary key, a weak entity uses the primary key of the identifying entity set along with extra attributes, known as discriminator attributes, to uniquely identify itself. But a strong entity set has its own independent primary key.\nFor example, we can consider two entity sets, “Pets”, which is the identifying set with primary key PetID, and “PetVaccine” which is the weak entity set. Each vaccine record doesn’t have a unique identifier on its own; its existence depends on the specific pet it is associated with. Instead of having a standalone primary key, “PetVaccine” might use a combination of attributes like PetID and additional attributes like VaccineDate to uniquely identify a vaccine record linked to a particular pet.\nQ2: SQL exercise:\na) Consider the query;\nSELECT course_id, semester, year, sec_id, AVG (tot_cred)\nFROM takes NATURAL JOIN student\nWHERE year = 2017\nGROUP BY course_id, semester, year, sec_id\nHAVING COUNT (ID) &gt;= 2;\ni. Explain why appending natural join section in the from clause would not change the\nresult. (Consult Ch. 4, 4.1.1)\nAdding “natural join section” to the “FROM” clause wouldn’t make a difference because the query already uses the “natural join” keyword to connect the “takes” and “student” tables based on shared column names. The “natural join” automatically combines columns with matching names in both tables. Since the “section” table is indirectly involved through “takes,” explicitly stating “natural join section” won’t change the result, as the conditions are already set by the existing join.\nii. Test the results using the Online SQL interpreter\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Image showing original query results\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Image showing query results with appended ‘section’ table\n\n\nb) Write an SQL query using the university schema to find the ID of each student who has never taken a course at the university. Do this using no subqueries and no set operations (use an outer join). (Consult Ch. 4, 4.1.3)\nSELECT s.ID\nFROM student s\nLEFT JOIN takes t ON s.ID = t.ID\nWHERE t.ID IS NULL;\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Results of query for student who has taken no course\n\n\nQ3: Design an E-R diagram for keeping track of the scoring statistics of your favorite sports team. You should store the matches played, the scores in each match, the players in each match, and individual player scoring statistics for each match. Summary statistics should be modeled as derived attributes with an explanation as to how they are computed. (Consult: Practice Exercise solutions on textbook website)\na) Draw the E-R diagram using draw.io. Read this website for instructions.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: E-R Diagram showing favorite team statistics. Type 1\n\n\n\nNote: Season_score() is the derived attribute obtained by summing the score values associated with ‘player’ entity set through the ‘played’ relationship set. In type 2, points is the derived attribute obtained through the associated relationship between ‘match’ and ‘match players’ entity sets in the ERD below.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: E-R Diagram showing favorite team statistics.

    "text": "Q1: An E-R diagram can be viewed as a graph. What do the following mean in terms of the structure of an enterprise schema?\na) The graph is disconnected.\nThis means that there are separate, isolated groups of entities and relationships within the schema. Each group, or subgraph, does not have any connections to the other groups.\nb) The graph has a cycle.\nThis indicates that there is at least one circular relationship in the schema, where entities are connected in a loop. In E-R diagrams, cycles can introduce complexity and may lead to challenges in database design, as they can imply dependencies that need careful consideration. In terms of an enterprise schema, cycles might represent intricate interdependencies or feedback loops within the database structure.\nQ2: We can convert any weak entity set to a strong entity set by simply adding appropriate attributes. Why, then, do we have weak entity sets?\nNormalization: The use of weak entities aligns with the principles of normalization in database design. By separating out entities with dependent existences, it can lead to a more normalized database schema, reducing redundancy caused by storing the same primary key multiple times.\nDatabase Integrity: Modeling entities as weak helps enforce certain integrity constraints in the database.\nQ3: SQL exercise:\na) Consider the employee database:\n\nwhere the primary keys are underlined. Give an expression in SQL for each of the following queries. (Hint: use from employee as e, works as w, company as c, manages as m)\ni. Find ID and name of each employee who lives in the same city as the location of the company for which the employee works.\nSELECT e.ID, e.person_name\nFROM Employee e, Works w, Company c\nWHERE e.city = c.city AND w.company_name = c.company_name;\nii. Find ID and name of each employee who lives in the same city and on the same street as does her or his manager. Wrong needs a subquery\nSELECT e.ID, e.person_name\nFROM Employee e, Manages m\nWHERE e.city = manager.city AND e.street = manager.street AND e.ID = m.ID;\niii. Find ID and name of each employee who earns more than the average salary of all employees of her or his company.\nSELECT e.ID, e.person_name\nFROM Employee e, Works w\nWHERE e.ID = w.ID AND w.salary &gt; (\nSELECT AVG(salary)\nFROM Works\nWHERE company_name = w.company_name\n);\na) Consider the following SQL query that seeks to find a list of titles of all courses taught in Spring 2017 along with the name of the instructor.\nSELECT name, title\nFROM instructor NATURAL JOIN teaches NATURAL JOIN section NATURAL JOIN course\nWHERE semester = ‘Spring’ AND year = 2017\nWhat is wrong with this query? (Hint: check book website)\nThe syntax of the query is correct, but it will not give the correct answer for the list of titles and instructors of all courses taught in 2017. This is because the natural join clause used joins columns/attributes that tables have in common and eliminates the rest. Because instructor and course both have 'dept_name' as attributes, this query will only return values where the instructor and course are from the same department and would remove those values where instructor departments and course departments don't match.\n\nDownloads available here\n\n\n\nPDF Version"

    "text": "Q1: Look up websites containing the following data representations:\n\na) Using JSON\n\n\nb) Using XML\n\n\nAnalyze the websites in terms of structure and composition. Name the technology/methods used for creating the web database.\nAns\na) Using JSON:\nJSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON defines only two data structures: objects and arrays. An object is a set of name-value pairs, and an array is a list of values. JSON defines seven value types: string, number, object, array, true, false, and null (Introduction to JSON, 2024). Examples of websites that use JSON are YouTube and Reddit.\nJSON syntax/structure can be summarized as follows (Introduction to JSON, 2024):\n\nObjects: Enclosed in braces {}, containing name-value pairs separated by commas. Names are strings, followed by a colon (:) and their corresponding values. Values can be any of the seven types, including objects or arrays.\nArrays: Enclosed in brackets [], with values separated by commas. Each value within an array can be of a different type, including objects or arrays.\nStructure: Objects and arrays can contain other objects or arrays, creating a hierarchical or tree-like structure for the data.\n\nTechnology/Methods for Web Database:\n\nBackend technologies such as Node.js, Python Django, or Java Spring may be used for server-side processing and database interactions (JSON Defined, 2024).\nDatabases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Firebase may be utilized to store structured data (JSON Databases Explained, 2024).\nAPIs are commonly used to expose JSON data to client-side applications, enabling dynamic content retrieval and manipulation.\n\nb) Using XML:\nXML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It’s often used for representing structured data in documents on the web (XML (eXtensible Markup Language), 2024).\nStructure and Composition Analysis(Murrell, 2024):\n\nXML documents consist of nested elements, each with a start tag, content, and an end tag.\nAttributes may be used within elements to provide additional metadata or properties.\nXML documents often follow a hierarchical structure, similar to a tree, with parent-child relationships between elements.\nXML namespaces may be used to avoid naming conflicts and enable the mixing of different XML vocabularies.\n\nTechnology/Methods for Web Database:\n\nXML databases like BaseX, eXist-db, or MarkLogic may be used for storing and querying XML data directly.\nXQuery or XPath may be used to query and manipulate XML data.\nServer-side technologies like Java servlets, ASP.NET, PHP, or Python with frameworks like Flask or Django may be used for generating XML documents dynamically.\nTransformation technologies like XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) may be used to convert XML data into different formats for presentation.\n\n\n\n\nQ2: SQL exercise:\n\nI. Express the following query in SQL using no subqueries and no set operations. (Hint: left outer join).\nSELECT ID FROM student\nEXCEPT\nSELECT s_id FROM advisor WHERE i_ID IS NOT null\n\n\n\nFig 1: Results for SQL query using except\n\n\nAns:\nSELECT ID\nFROM student s\nLEFT JOIN advisor a ON s.ID = s_id\nWHERE i_id IS NULL;\n\n\n\nFig 2: Results for SQL query using left join\n\n\n\n\nII. Using the university schema, write an SQL query to find the names and IDs of those instructors who teach every course taught in his or her department (i.e., every course that appears in the course relation with the instructor’s department name). Order result by name.\nAns:\nSELECT DISTINCT i.ID, i.name\nFROM instructor i\nJOIN teaches t ON i.ID = t.ID\nJOIN course c ON t.course_id = c.course_id\nJOIN department d ON i.dept_name = d.dept_name\nGROUP BY i.ID, i.name\nHAVING COUNT(DISTINCT c.course_id) = (\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM course\nWHERE dept_name = i.dept_name\n)\nORDER BY i.name;\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Results of SQL query for instructors that teach every course offered in their department.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nIntroduction to JSON.
